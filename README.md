Javaslang Hamcrest matchers
===========================

Provides a set of useful Hamcrest matchers for operating on Javaslang values.

This makes it possible to easily define Hamcrest-style assertions on types such as 
`Option<T>` or Try<T>`.

Currently WIP, but fret not - a better `README` is coming.

In the meantime please see the tests for usage examples.
