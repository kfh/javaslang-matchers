Javaslang Hamcrest matchers
===========================

Provides a set of useful Hamcrest matchers for operating on Javaslang values.

This makes it possible to easily define Hamcrest-style assertions on types such as 
`Option<T>` or Try<T>`.

## Usage

This project is not yet published on Maven Central, but you can `mvn install` it locally.
